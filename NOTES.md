CRUD app => Create, Read, Update, Delete

Traveler's Insight App

Goal 1:

Tourist, Country, Recommendation => A tourist can belong to many countries, a country can belong to many tourists, a recommendation belongs to both a tourist and a country

Goal 2:

If we want to create an app to create recommendations for countries on Traverler's Insight, we might write:

As a user, I want to enter a location and be given a recommendation (of where to eat, where to go for that country) (Read)
As a user, I want to be able enter a country and give a reccomendation (of where to eat, where to go for that country) (Write)
As a user, I want to be able to enter a country and be given a random recommendation (of where to eat, where to go) (Read)
As a user, I want to be able to update my recommendation for a given country on (where to eat, where to go) (Update)
As a user, I want to be able to delete my recommendation for a given country on (where to eat, where to go) (Delete)

Minimum Viable Project (MVP) :

Adding a country with a recommendation of where to eat or where to go (Update)
Deleting a recommendation for a country (Delete)
Selecting a country to see where to eat or where to go (Read)
Updating recommendations for a country (Update)
